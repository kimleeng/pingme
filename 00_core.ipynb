    "This is a first attempt at using nbdev to develop a package, commentary is added to the code to explain the process. [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) is a tool to develop packages using python jupyter notebooks. It provides a set of tools (can check via `nbdev_help`) which makes what you write in this notebook a package. If you follow conventions it uses it also includes testing which can be automatically turned into github actions, and releases for both conda and pypi. It accomplishes this by transforming notebook code into a standard python package and using information in certain files and folders (notably `settings.ini` and `*.ipynb`) to create a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it's important to organize other files you add to this structure so you're aware of which files are auto generated and which ones aren't. This also encourages a different way to approach the code that is focused on explanation more so than pure structure. For examply when creating the class is this notebook I purposefully didn't put many methods with the intiail declaration. Instead I included the basics and then used `fastcore.utils.patch` to \"patch\" in additional methods. These methods are then associated with the class (I believe it uses the typeclass of self to know where it goes) when converted. In terms of final code it looks a little less organized but in terms of process you can create your object, add some tests to ensure it works, then patch in a function, test that inidividual function, and continue till all functions are added. This goes better with explanations but worse for at a glance results. Because of this library imports are not all at the top of the notebook. Instead they are added as needed as the code is written for understanding. This may cause some issues with remembering to include packages in the `conda.env.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A plus from this is docs are also auto created. This means each section should be demarked by a `#|hide` or `#|export` tag, with the `#|export` tag being used for all code that makes it to production. It appears `#|hide` can also be applied to markdown to exclude it, having `#|export` in markdown doesn't force include it though, so more likely an interaction with any tags. If you use neither it appears in the docs but not in the production code. I should also mention quickly that it appears `nbdev` is still relatively new but it feels like you should be able to make any kind of python package with this, including CLI. Also note that `#|export` which needed for including to modules does not include in documentation always, this looks like it applies to all non-function exports. All code blocks seen are either from functions or are not exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe the tests that go to github actions are ones using the `fastcore.test` library. So using this should offer that functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a more minor note I've developed in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using a jupyter notebook environment built from `conda.env.yml` and pointing my Jupyter Server to the associated `python` created (`./venv/bin/python`). I find this makes most things easier but some integration (certain auto-completions) of `nbdev` is currently designed to work through a server based [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sections of markdown labeled with `#|hide` should be assumed as further developer notes and not intended for the final product."
